Description: Statistical distribution in OOP (Object Oriented Programming) way.
             This package proposes a R6 class interface to classic statistical
             distribution, and new distributions can be easily added with the
             class AbstractDist. A useful point is the generic fit() method for
             each class, which uses a maximum likelihood estimation to find the
             parameters of a dataset, see, e.g. Hastie, T. and al (2009)
             <isbn:978-0-387-84857-0>. Furthermore, the rv_histogram class
             gives a non-parametric fit, with the same accessors that for the
             classic distribution. Finally, three random generators useful to
             build synthetic data are given: a multivariate normal generator, an
             orthogonal matrix generator, and a symmetric positive definite
             matrix generator, see Mezzadri, F. (2007)
             <arXiv:math-ph/0609050>.
